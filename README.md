# Advanced Fruit Quality Assessment Using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning Technique
This study utilized transfer learning with Four pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models—MobileNetV2, ResNet50, VGG16, and EfficientNetB0 —to detect the quality of five fruits: apple, banana, strawberry, orange, and mango. All models were trained and tested with a public labeled fruit images dataset, and their performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
